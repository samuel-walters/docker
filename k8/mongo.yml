# Mongo Service
# This service does not have a type field. 
# If a Service does not have a type field, Kubernetes assigns it the default type ClusterIP.
# ClusterIP makes the Pod accessible from within the cluster, but not from outside 
# â€” this is fine because the only entity that has to access the MongoDB Pod is the app.
